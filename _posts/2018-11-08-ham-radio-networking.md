This looks like a pretty good list of repeaters in the triangle:

It looks like your radio has a scan feature. (Found a list of the UV-5R's menus here, btw). I definitely recommend giving that a try if you're interested in checking out local activity. On my radio, I can tell it to scan a given range (e.g. 144 - 148 MHZ) and it will look through the range of frequencies until it picks up a signal. It's a good way of finding activity any time of day. I've heard some folks recommend listening in on a conversation, waiting for it to wrap up, then dropping your call sign and calling CQ (radio lingo for 'I'm available to talk') afterward. Might be a little easier than calling CQ on a repeater station. I've also found that the evening is a much more popular time to chat and that the weekends are also a little busier.

Another good way of contacting others is to find nets (radio lingo for regular radio meetings at a specific time on a specific frequency with generally the same agenda each week). Getting connected with the local ARES (Amateur Radio Emergency Service) group is another way of getting connected quickly (here are links for the Durham and CH chapters). The folks in my local chapter have been really friendly, generous with their time, and have decades worth of experience. By far the best curated list of local repeaters / frequencies I have came directly from my local ARES chapter. From what I've seen, online repeater listings can sometimes end up being a bit haphazard.

When programming your channels, recommend checking out CHIRP. Hooking up your radio and programming it via CHIRP can be much easier / lot faster than using the Baofeng menus. In addition to the CHIRP software, you'll need a cable to connect your radio to your computer. (Note: In order to get CHIRP to work, I had to download / install the Python runtime mentioned here).

If you're interested in building kits or low power radio (QRP), the QRP Labs mailing list has been an absolute gold mine for getting help with the questions I've had. I post a question at night and by the morning have seven thoughtful entries from folks (all around the world) who sound like they have pretty deep experience. The mailing list must be huge and again def. seems to attract a pretty serious crowd.

Hope that helps! Happy radio-ing!
