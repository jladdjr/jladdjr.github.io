Indeed, it's been a whole ten months since I last wrote.. what happened!?

Well, life, I guess. Covid certainly has thrown everything, everywhere a pretty big curve ball and steno practice has been no exception.

I also think that the way that I was trying to learn steno was making things harder than they really needed to be; in hindsight, I think I was bringing an unrealistic expectation to each practice session: that somehow _that session_ would unlock the secret to making a huge jump forward with steno. I think that was a pretty good recipe for burnout.

Recently, though, I've been trying a different approach -- it's called Beeminder.

With Beeminder, you set a goal -- sometimes referred to as a commitment contract -- that you are bound to, otherwise.. they charge your credit card. Serious business, right?

For me, this has felt amazing. First of all, it definitely means that I get pretty serious about my goals. But it also -- and perhaps this is the more relevant part for steno -- it helps me to focus on taking things one day at a time.

Here's a look at my Beeminder goal for steno:

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

Without going into too much detail about how everything works here, basically, I've pledged to practice steno for five minutes a day. If I fall too far behind I'll cross over the red line and then have to pay Beeminder. That's called derailing.
