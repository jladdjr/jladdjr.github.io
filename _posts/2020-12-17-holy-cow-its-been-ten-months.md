Indeed, it's been a whole ten months since I last wrote.. what happened!?

Well, life, I guess. Covid certainly has thrown everything, everywhere a pretty big curve ball and steno practice has been no exception.

I also think that the way that I was trying to learn steno was also making things harder than they really needed to be; in hindsight, I think I was bringing an unrealistic expectation to each practice session: that somehow, _that session_ would somehow unlock the secret to making a huge jump forward with steno. I think that was a pretty good recipe for burnout.

Recently, though, I've been trying a different approach -- it's called Beeminder.

With Beeminder, you set a goal -- sometimes referred to as a commitment contract -- that you are bound to, otherwise.. they charge your credit card. Serious business, right?

For me, this has felt amazing. First of all, it definitely means that I get pretty serious about my goals. But it also -- and perhaps this is the more relevant part for steno -- it helps me to focus on taking things one day at a time.

Here's a look at my Beeminder goal for steno:

Without going into too much detail about how everything works here, basically, I've pledged to practice steno for 5 minutes a day. If I cross the red line, then pay Beeminder. That's called derailing.
