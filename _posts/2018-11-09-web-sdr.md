[University of Twente Wide-band WebSDR](http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/)

Lets you move to any frequency you want and listen in using a variety of modes. Based in the Netherlands. You can literally hop over to 7000 KHz and just start listening to morse, or head a little further up and listen to SSB, or go further and listen to AM.. And it actually lets you visualize all of the activity, too. The first time I checked out the site I was able to listen to a Spain-based radio station, Russians chatting on SSB, and someone from Ukraine calling CQ in morse. Thought this was unbelievable. You get the experience of a fully set-up HF radio, for free. (It's receive-only, but still, pretty awesome).
