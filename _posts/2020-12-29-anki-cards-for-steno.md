A while ago, before I took my hiatus from steno for a bit, I made a set of [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) flash cards for studying steno translations. The cards cover the top 10,000 most commonly used words. The cards are available [here](https://github.com/jladdjr/anki-decks).

Some things that I learned from studying these cards:

* It is really easy to bite off more than you can chew. I think this is probably true of Anki in general, but I was pretty excited about getting as many translations under my belt as I could, as quickly as I could, so perhaps it was especially true in this case. So, a word to the wise -- pace yourself, go slow, and pick a  modest number of words to study each day, even if it feels like a really low number.

* There are so, so many words to study, holy cow. In fact, maybe _too_ many words. So, my next piece of add advice would be, when it comes to learning objectives, mix it up; yes, it's great to boost your vocab, but there are also other things. I guess that when I started studying the cards I thought "man, if I can just learn _all_ of the words, then surely I can use steno full-time, for everything." Welllllll.. that turned out not to be true. There is just so much to learning steno, that I think it's unhelpful to tell yourself that once X happens, then you'll be able to Y. I've found that with steno, it's more helpful for me to let things happen on there own schedule. I try to make studying as fun as I can, enjoy milestones when they come up, but hold my expectations about progress loosely.

* Okay, so, the first two points are about pitfalls. My next point is that while Anki study can be tricky, it is also so, so powerful. Oh, man. I think Anki really can help you to memorize just about anything. It's really addictive, and the whole idea of [Spaced Repetition Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) is so effective that.. just wow.. Anyways, you just have to try it.

* Hmmm, what else? I think that may be it for now, so, now that we're here, I recommend you give the cards a shot! See if you like them. At the end of the day, I think they are just one more tool to add to your toolbox, one of many that can help you build proficiency for steno.

Happy studying!
