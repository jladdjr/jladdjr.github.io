Okay, so, to recap... I went to PyCon, got to hang out with some of the realtime captioners, and got hooked on steno.

The conference was wrapping up. Where would I go from here?

Well, before leaving the conference, I asked Mirabai and some  others if they thought this was something that people could actually pick up and use for coding. To be honest, I was a little scared about what the answer would be. Much to my amazement, the answer was an emphatic "Yes!" It was another unbelievable moment. It's not every day that a pro tells you a new skill is just waiting for you.

If you're interested, you can actually see for yourself what it looks like for a developer to code in steno -- check it out: [coding in steno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBBiri3CD6w&t=15s).

Before I headed home, I was already looking into getting a steno machine that I could practice on. But that's the thing: where do you go if you want to get started with steno?

Well, one fantastic resource is... the steno community! There's a pretty active [Discord server for Plover](https://discord.gg/fyTp6N) that hosts a rich community of makers, tinkerers, and hobbyists that have come up with all kinds of steno boards that you can use.

Here's the board that I bought while still at the conference (that's right; I couldn't even wait until I got back home to buy a board ðŸ˜„) -- it's called the [Georgi](https://www.gboards.ca/product/georgi), one of many killer boards by [Jeremy Bernhardt](https://www.gboards.ca/about):

After a few months of practicing steno, I bought a second board  that looked like something I could use while traveling -- the [TinyMod](https://stenomod.blogspot.com/2019/09/assembling-tinymod4.html), a stellar board by Charley Shattuck:

Both boards have been awesome. Love 'em both. ðŸ˜Ž Here are some things that I enjoy about each board:

Georgi:

* keys are super light
* split keyboard -- gives you a lot of flexibility when trying to find an ergonomic setup
* all around beautiful board (has an amazing [silk screen](https://assets.bigcartel.com/product_images/235027235/imadd+ge0.jpg?auto=format&fit=max&w=1120) on the back)
* has a Qwerty mode if you want to switch back to a traditional board at any point!

TinyMod:

* board is a single unit -- makes it a lot easier to tote around when traveling
* keys require more force to activate (makes the board a bit more forgiving if you like to rest your hands on the board)
* another solid board with a beautiful design

Both boards have been vetted by a pro and received high marks!  Here are links to both reviews:

Its pretty incredible to have sturdy, well-designed boards at reasonable prices come out of the maker community. I'm extremely grateful to have these available (Honestly, not sure where I'd even start looking to get a board if these weren't around!) If you've been thinking about getting started with steno, I definitely recommend checking them out!
